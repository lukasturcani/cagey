[bright_magenta]cagey[/] creates and manages a database of cage data so \
that you don't have to and can focus on data analysis.

[bold green underline]What it's for[/]

We collect a range of experimental and computational data about cages, \
including their precursors, mass spectra, NMR and so on. This data \
comes in a range of dissimilar formats and is located across a broad range \
of files. Not so good for doing data analysis! [bright_magenta]cagey[/] \
organises this data into a single database, allowing you to jump right \
into the analysis of your data, as it will be stored in a standardised \
and well documented format. You will also be able to share your data \
with other people, as all your data will be stored in a single file.

[bold green underline]How it works[/]

First your create a new database using the \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]new[/] command. This will create a new \
database file and populate it with the data in the folder you provide. \
The data in the folder should be organised in a standardised format, \
described in help of the [green]new[/] command, i.e. when you run \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]help[/] [blue]new[/]. Your database file \
will contain all the data in the folder, but in a standardised format. \
The data in the database can be extracted into data frames, so that \
you can work with polars, pandas, or any other data analysis library you \
like. I strongly reccomend using polars - \
https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/getting-started - \
as it is much faster than pandas, and has more intuitive API. Worth it for \
even the seasoned pandas user!

The database you create is a standard SQLite database, meaning the data \
comes in the form of tables, and you can use SQL to query the data. \
You do not have to know SQL to use [bright_magenta]cagey[/], Python will be \
sufficient, but it is \
useful to know, as it will allow you to do more complex queries. If you \
would like to learn SQL, I reccomend the following tutorial - \
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql - it takes about 5 hours to \
complete.

Once you have your database you will write your own Python scripts to \
read the data held by it and perform data analysis on it. You won't need \
to have [bright_magenta]cagey[/] installed to do this step! \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] is just a command line tool to help you create and \
manage your database. The \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] documentation - https://cagey.readthedocs.io \
- contains examples for writing your own Python data analysis scripts using \
the [bright_magenta]cagey[/] database.

[bold green underline]How to use it[/]

[bright_magenta]cagey[/] is a command line tool composed of several \
sub-commands. You can see a list of these sub-commands by running \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/]. You can get help on how to use \
each sub-command by running \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]help[/] [blue]sub-command[/]. For example, \
to get help on how to use the [green]new[/] sub-command, you would run \
[bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]help[/] [blue]new[/].

Normally you will use [bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]new[/] to create a new \
database, and [bright_magenta]cagey[/] [green]insert[/] to insert new data \
into the database. That's pretty much it! Once you have your database you can \
write your own Python scripts to read the data held by it and perform data \
analysis on it. Look at https://cagey.readthedocs.io for examples of how to \
do this."""
